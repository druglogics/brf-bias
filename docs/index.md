# Background {-}

In this section we introduce basic concepts, definitions and notations.

## Boolean functions {-}

**Boolean regulatory functions (BRFs)** are Boolean functions used in the context of biological networks and modeling.
A mathematical presentation of such a function associates the activity output of a target biological entity with the Boolean input values of $n$ variables (the *regulators*), such that $f_{BRF}:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$.
Thus, the target's output state is binary, i.e. either $0$ (FALSE, denoting an inactive/inhibited state) or $1$ (TRUE, indicating an active state).

The most intuitive representation of a Boolean function is its *truth table*, which is a list of all possible Boolean input configurations of the $n$ regulators along with their associated function output.
Since for every regulator, there are two possible values ($0$ and $1$), the total number of input configurations (i.e. rows) in a truth table is $2^n$.
For example, a Boolean function $f(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ with $3$ regulators has a total of $2^3=8$ rows in its corresponding truth table, starting from the input configuration $(0,0,0)$ and ending with $(1,1,1)$ (see [Table 1](#table1)).

The total number of BRFs with $n$ regulators is $2^{2^n}$ and the easiest way to think about it is to see that for each input configuration (i.e. row of the truth table) there can be only two possible function outcomes ($0$ or $1$).
In our example with $3$ regulators and a total of $8$ rows in the truth table, that would be a total of $2^8=256$ functions, three of which are shown in [Table 1](#table1) below.

## Truth Density {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}<div class="definition"><span class="definition" id="def:td-def"><strong>(\#def:td-def) </strong></span>**Truth density (TD)** of a Boolean function is the fraction of all input configurations in its corresponding truth table that yield a TRUE outcome (i.e. the function outputs 1).</div>\EndKnitrBlock{definition}
<br>
Note that the truth density of a Boolean function rests in the $[0,1]$ interval.
Using the example with the three functions from [Table 1](#table1), we have $TD_{f_1}=3/8=0.375$,  $TD_{f_2}=5/8=0.625$ and $TD_{f_3}=8/8=1$, where the last function is the *tautology*, with the maximum possible truth density.

We will say that a Boolean regulatory function is **biased**, when it’s truth density is close to $0$ or 1.
Since the size of a truth table grows exponentially with the number of inputs a Boolean function has ($n$ input regulators correspond to $2^n$ rows), the existence of bias conveys the information that most of the input regulatory configurations result in either an activated or an inhibited target (bias towards $0$ or $1$ respectively).
On the other hand, we shall say that a Boolean function is **balanced**, if it takes on the values $0$ and $1$ equally often, or equivalently, it’s truth density is close to $\frac12$ [@Benjamini2005].

## The DNF form {-}

The most practically used form of a Boolean function is its **analytical form**, where variables are connected with logical operators such as AND ($\land$), OR ($\lor$), NOT ($\lnot$), XOR ($\oplus$), etc. and the output of the function is calculated using basic Boolean algebra.
In [Table 1](#table1) for example, we provide the analytical forms for the functions $f_1$ and $f_2$.
Note that there can be multiple analytical forms that essentially compute the same function, e.g. another form of the $f_1$ function is $f_1^{'}=(\lnot x_1 \land x_2 \land \lnot x_3) \lor (x_1 \land \lnot x_2 \land \lnot x_3) \lor (x_1 \land x_2 \land \lnot x_3)$.

This brings us to the notion of a general form which could be used to define useful metrics common to all Boolean functions (e.g. complexity), as well as the need to provide minimal forms.
This need does not come only from a representation point of view (a more compact function form enhances readability, e.g. compare $f_1$ with $f_1^{'}$), but is also a motivation for the design of optimal digital circuits, since the number of gates used (i.e. logical operators) is an indicator of computation time and affects the efficiency of a circuit [@wegener1987complexity].

Every Boolean function can be represented in a **disjunctive normal form or DNF**, requiring only AND ($\land$), OR ($\lor$) and NOT ($\lnot$) operators as building blocks.
In such a representation, *literals*, which are variables (e.g. positive literal $x$) or their negations (e.g. negative literal $\text{NOT }x$), are connected by AND's producing **terms**, which are then in turn connected by OR's [@crama2011boolean].
For example, every function in [Table 1](#table1) is expressed in DNF form, while the Boolean expressions $\lnot (x_1 \lor x_2)$ and $\lnot (x_1\land x_2)\lor x_3$ are not.
Note that a Boolean function can have multiple DNF forms.

## Complexity {-}

The **length of a DNF** is defined as the number of its terms, i.e. the number of conjunctions separated by $\lor$ operators.
As such, $l_{f_1}=l_{f_2}=2$, $l_{f_3}=1$ and $l_{f_1^{'}}=3$ from [Table 1](#table1).
Intuitively speaking, the more terms a DNF has, the more complex it is.
This observation leads us to the following definition:

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}<div class="definition"><span class="definition" id="def:complexity-def"><strong>(\#def:complexity-def) </strong></span>The **complexity** $C$ of a Boolean function is the length of its **shortest DNF**, normalized by the total number of rows of its truth table [@Gherardi2016].</div>\EndKnitrBlock{definition}
<br>
For example, using the functions from [Table 1](#table1), for which the minimum DNF expression is given, we have that $C_{f_1}=C_{f_2}=2/8$, $C_{f_3}=1/8$, where the tautology $f_3$ is assigned the smallest possible complexity.

Note that *minimizing* the DNF form of a Boolean function to get an equivalent expression with the shortest number of terms, is considered a computational difficult problem and there can be multiple such minimum DNF representations for a single Boolean function.

## Link operator Boolean Regulatory Functions {-}

We consider the class of BRFs that partitions the input variables (regulators) to two sets: the set of positive regulators (also called *activators*) and the set of negative regulators (also called *inhibitors*).
Let $f$ be such a Boolean function $f(x,y):\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, with $m \ge 1$ **activators** $x=\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{m}$ and $k \ge 1$ **inhibitors** $y=\{y_j\}_{j=1}^{k}$, that is a total of $n = m + k$ regulators.
The **link operator BRFs** have an analytical non-DNF form, which places the two distinct types of regulators in two separate expressions, while connecting them with a special logical operator that we call a **link operator**.

An example of such a function that has been used extensively in the logical modeling literature is the standardized BRF formula with the “AND-NOT” link operator [@Mendoza2006]:

$$f_{AND-NOT}(x,y) = \left(\bigvee_{i=1}^{m} x_i\right) \land \lnot \left(\bigvee_{j=1}^{k} y_j\right)$$

A **variation** of the above function is the “OR-NOT” link operator function:

$$f_{OR-NOT}(x,y) = \left(\bigvee_{i=1}^{m} x_i\right) \lor \lnot \left(\bigvee_{j=1}^{k} y_j\right)$$

Note that the presence of the link operator is what forces the condition $m,k \ge 1$ (at least one regulator in each category).
For the rest of this work, we will not consider BRFs with only one type of regulator, since these can be represented by simple logical functions without loss of interpretability or biological consistency.
Following the notation introduced in [@Mendoza2006], we have the case of only activators:

$$f(x)=\bigvee_{i=1}^{m} x_i$$
where the presence of at least one activator makes the function output *TRUE* (active).
Similarly, in the case of only inhibitors we have:

$$f(y)=\lnot \bigvee_{j=1}^{k} y_j=\bigwedge_{j=1}^{k} \lnot y_j$$
where the presence of at least one inhibitor is enough to make the target inhibited (*FALSE*).

Borrowing notation from circuit theory, we could use other link operators like the `NAND`, `NOR`, `XNOR` ($\odot$) gates, combined with the `NOT` operator or not.
Note that the operator used to connect the same type of regulators (e.g. the activators) is usually the OR, but other operators could be used as well.

:::{#pairs-fun}
For example, another link operator function is the “Pairs” function:
:::
$$f_{Pairs}(x,y) = \bigvee_{\forall (i,j)}^{m,k}(x_i\land \lnot y_j) = \left(\bigvee_{i=1}^{m} x_i\right) \land \left(\bigvee_{j=1}^{k} \lnot y_j\right)$$

The intuition behind the name is derived from the fact that the function will return *TRUE* if there is at least one pair of regulators consisting of a **present activator** and an **absent inhibitor**.
The function is also expressed in conjunction normal form (CNF), which is the reverse of the DNF: two separate clauses are connected with AND’s ($\land$) and inside the clauses the literals are connected with OR’s ($\lor$).

:::{.note}
@Cury2019 defined the **consistent Boolean regulatory** functions and their respective **complete DNF forms (CDNF)**.

The link operator functions listed above are a subset of these functions, since they respect the regulatory structure in their respective CDNF forms (for the *Pairs* function it's evident since it's expressed first in the CDNF form - for the *AND-NOT* and *OR-NOT* functions, see their respective (complete) DNF forms in the truth density proofs \@ref(prp:and-not-proof) and \@ref(prp:or-not-proof).
:::

## Threshold functions {-}

**Boolean threshold functions** are a special kind of Boolean functions for which the output depends on the condition that the sum of (possibly weighted) activities of the input regulators surpass a given *threshold* value [@crama2011boolean].

In this work, we will use two simple threshold functions, which both output $1$ when **the number of present activators is larger than the number of present inhibitors**.
As such, the activators and inhibitors are combined in an *additive* manner, with their respective assigned weights set to $\pm1$ and the threshold parameter to $0$, formulating thus a *majority rule* which defines the value of the function [@Bornholdt2008; @Chaouiya2013].
These functions differ with regards to their output when there is balance between the activities of the positive and negative regulators: the first outputs $1$ (the activators “win”) while the second outputs $0$ (the inhibitors “win”).

$$f_{Act-win}(x,y)=\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{for } \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i \ge \sum_{j=1}^{k} y_j\\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$$
$$f_{Inh-win}(x,y)=\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{for } \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i \gt \sum_{j=1}^{k} y_j\\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$$

Note that: $f_{Inh-win}(x,y) = \lnot f_{Act-win}(y,x)$.

:::{.blue-box}
Note that every Boolean threshold function has an equivalent combinatorial expression and I searched for an analytic formula for the two last threshold functions.

# Truth Density Data Analysis {-}

## Data {-}

I created every possible truth table for up to $20$ variables (variables here means *regulators* for us) and calculated the “AND-NOT”, “OR-NOT”, “Pairs”, “Act-win”, “Inh-win” Boolean function results for every possible configuration of the number of activators and inhibitors that added up to the number of regulators.
Then, from the truth tables I calculated the **truth density** of each function for each particular configuration.

## Truth Density formulas {-}

In this section we prove the exact formulas for the truth densities in the case of the $f_{AND-NOT}$, $f_{OR-NOT}$ and $f_{Pairs}$ link operator Boolean functions, as well as for the two threshold functions $f_{Act-win}$ and $f_{Inh-win}$.
We also show how each truth density formula asymptotically behaves for a large number of regulators and investigate the cases where there is either balance or imbalance between the number of activators and inhibitors.
Lastly, we validate the proofs with the above [data](#tr-data).

### TD Proofs {-}

For all propositions presented, we assume that:

To calculate the $TD_{AND-NOT}$, we need to find the number of rows of the $f_{AND-NOT}$ truth table that result in a *TRUE* output result and divide that by the total number of rows, which is $2^n$ ($n$ regulators/inputs).
Note that $f_{AND-NOT}$, written in it's equivalent DNF form, has exactly $m$ terms.
Each term has a unique *TRUE/FALSE* assignment of regulators that makes it *TRUE*.
This happens when the activator of the term is *TRUE* and all of the inhibitors *FALSE*.
Since the condition for the inhibitors is the same regardless of the term we are looking at and $f$ is expressed in a DNF form, the *TRUE* outcomes of the function $f$ are defined by all logical assignment combinations of the $m$ activators that have at least one of them being *TRUE* and all inhibitors assigned as *FALSE*.
There are a total of $2^m$ possible $TRUE/FALSE$ logical assignments of the $m$ activators (from all *FALSE* to all *TRUE*) and $f_{AND-NOT}$ becomes *TRUE* on all except one of them (i.e. when all activators are *FALSE*) and the corresponding $2^m-1$ truth table rows have all inhibitors assigned as *FALSE*.
Thus $TD_{AND-NOT}=\frac{2^m-1}{2^n}$.</div>\EndKnitrBlock{proof}

Thus $TD_{OR-NOT} = \frac{2^n-R_{false}}{2^n}$.
Note that $f_{OR-NOT}$, written in it's equivalent DNF form, has exactly $m+1$ terms.
To make $f_{OR-NOT}$ *FALSE*, we first need to assign the $m$ activators as *FALSE* and then it all depends on the logical assignments of the inhibitors $y_j$ that are part of the last DNF term.

Thus only the rows that have at least one inhibitor absent/*FALSE* will be left (and of course at least one activator present), which corresponds exactly to the $f_{Pairs}$ formula's biological interpretation.

$R_{act}$ can be found by subtracting from the total number of rows ($2^n$) the rows that have all activators absent/*FALSE*.
How many are these rows? Their number depends on the number of inhibitors, since for each one of the total possible $2^k$ *TRUE/FALSE* logical assignments of the $k$ inhibitors (ranging from all *FALSE* to all *TRUE*), there will be a row in the truth table with all activators as *FALSE*.
Thus, $R_{act} = 2^n - 2^k$.

$R_{inh}$ depends on the number of activators, since for each one of the total possible $2^m$ *TRUE/FALSE* assignments of the $m$ activators (ranging from all *FALSE* to all *TRUE*), there will be a row in the truth table with all inhibitors as *TRUE*.
Note that we have to exclude one row from this result, exactly the row that has all activators as *FALSE* since it's not included in the $R_{act}$ rows.

<br>
\BeginKnitrBlock{proof}<div class="proof">\iffalse{} <span class="proof"><em>Proof. </em></span>  \fi{}The above formulas are easily derived from the observation that we need to count the number of rows in the respective truth tables that have more present (assigned to *TRUE*) activators than present inhibitors (or equal in the case of $f_{Act-win}$ but that's a detail as we will see).

Firstly, we count all the subset input configurations that have up to $m$ activators present.
These include the partial *TRUE*/*FALSE* assignments that have just a single activator present, a pair of activators present, a triplet, etc.
This is exactly the term $\sum_{i=1}^m \binom{m}{i}$.
Note that each of these activator input configurations is multiplied by a factor of $2^k$ in the truth table to make 'full' rows, where the activator values stay the same and the inhibitor values range from all *FALSE* to all *TRUE*.
Thus, we need to specify exactly which inhibitor assignments are appropriate for each activator subset input configuration.
To do that, we multiply the size of each activator subset $\binom{m}{i}$ with the number of configurations that have less inhibitors present, i.e. $\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \binom{k}{j}$.

For example, if we take the number of subsets with $i=2$ activators present $\binom{m}{2}$, we need to multiply by the number of configurations that have one or no present inhibitors $\sum_{j=0}^{1} \binom{k}{j}$ to find the number of rows of interest.
That is of course the case of the $f_{Inh-win}$ function.
For the $f_{Act-win}$, we would have to add up to the present inhibitor pairs: $\sum_{j=0}^{2} \binom{k}{j}$ - so the sum in this case would be $\sum_{j=0}^{i} \binom{k}{j}$.
Lastly, note that the largest inhibitor configuration subset size that we can add up to, is the minimum value between the activator subset size ($i$ in the $f_{Act-win}$ formula and $i-1$ in the $f_{Inh-win}$ formula) and the total number of inhibitors $k$ (in the case where the number of inhibitors is less than the activator subset size).
This explains the terms $min(i,k)$ and $min(i-1,k)$ in the two truth density formulas.</div>\EndKnitrBlock{proof}

### Asymptotic behavior {-}

For a large number of regulators $n$, the truth densities of the “AND-NOT”, “OR-NOT” and “Pairs” functions can be simplified as follows:

- $TD_{AND-NOT} = \frac{1}{2^k}-\frac{1}{2^n} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2^k} \xrightarrow{k \rightarrow \infty}0$
- $TD_{OR-NOT} = 1 + \frac{1}{2^n} - \frac{1}{2^m} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 1-\frac{1}{2^m} \xrightarrow{m \rightarrow \infty} 1$
- $TD_{Pairs} = 1 - \frac{2^k+2^m-1}{2^n} = 1 - \frac{2^k+2^m}{2^n} + \frac{1}{2^n} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 1 - \frac{2^k+2^m}{2^n} = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{2^k}+\frac{1}{2^m}\right)$

:::{.green-box}
So, for large number of regulators $n$:

1. $TD_{AND-NOT}$ depends only **on the number of inhibitors** and tends towards $0$ with increasing number of inhibitors
2. $TD_{OR-NOT}$ depends only **on the number of activators** and tends towards $1$ with increasing number of activators
3. $TD_{Pairs}$ depends **both on the number of activators and the number of inhibitors**
4. The two threshold functions also depend **both on the number of activators and the number of inhibitors** (there is no simpler formula for $n \rightarrow \infty$)
:::

To see the effect of **the ratio between number of activators and inhibitors** on the truth density values when the number of regulators is large, we consider the following three scenarios for each of the Boolean functions:

1. **1:1 activator-to-inhibitor ratio** (approximately half of the regulators are activators and half are inhibitors, i.e. $m \approx k \approx n/2$, considering $n$ is even without loss of generality):
  - $TD_{AND-NOT} = \frac{1}{2^{n/2}} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 0$
  - $TD_{OR-NOT} = 1 - \frac{1}{2^{n/2}} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 1$
  - $TD_{Pairs} = 1 - \frac{2^{n/2}+2^{n/2}-1}{2^n} = 1 - \frac{1}{2^{(n/2)-1}} - \frac{1}{2^n} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 1$
  - $TD_{Act-win} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n/2} \left[ \binom{n/2}{i} \sum_{j=0}^{min(i,n/2)} \binom{n/2}{j} \right]}{2^n} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n/2} \left[ \binom{n/2}{i} \sum_{j=0}^i \binom{n/2}{j} \right]}{2^n}=\frac{N}{2^n}$
  
  We simplify $N$, by using the notation $z=\frac{n}{2}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}$ as a meta-symbol for $\binom{z}{x}$.
  For example, $\binom{n/2}{1}=\binom{z}{1}=\boldsymbol{1}$.
  $N$ is thus expressed as:
  
  $$N=\boldsymbol{1}(\boldsymbol{0}+\boldsymbol{1})+\boldsymbol{2}(\boldsymbol{0}+\boldsymbol{1}+\boldsymbol{2})+...+\boldsymbol{z}(\boldsymbol{0}+\boldsymbol{1}...+\boldsymbol{z})$$
  
  Using the symmetry of binomial coefficients: $\binom{z}{x}=\binom{z}{z-x} \sim \boldsymbol{x} =\boldsymbol{z-x}$, we can re-write $N$ as:
  
  $$N=(\boldsymbol{z-1})[\boldsymbol{z}+(\boldsymbol{z-1})]+(\boldsymbol{z-2})[\boldsymbol{z}+(\boldsymbol{z-1})+(\boldsymbol{z-2})]+...+\boldsymbol{0}[\boldsymbol{z}+...+\boldsymbol{0}]$$
  
  Adding the two expressions for $N$ we have that:
  
  $$2N=[\boldsymbol{0}+\boldsymbol{1}...+\boldsymbol{z}]^2+\boldsymbol{1}^2+\boldsymbol{2}^2+...+(\boldsymbol{z-1})^2=2^{2z}+\sum_{x=1}^{z-1} \boldsymbol{x}^2$$
  So, substituting back $\binom{z}{x}=\boldsymbol{x}$ and $i=x$, we have that: 
  $$TD_{Act-win}=\frac{(1/2) \left[2^{2z}+\sum_{i=1}^{z-1} \binom{z}{i}^2 \right]}{2^{2z}}$$
  
  As $n \rightarrow \infty$ (and hence $z \rightarrow \infty$), the term $\sum_{i=1}^{z-1} \binom{z}{i}^2$ does not grow as fast as $2^{2z}$ - it is smaller by a factor of $\sqrt{\pi z}$ (see answer to Problem 9.18 in [@Graham1994]), and so it becomes negligible:
  $$\lim_{z\to\infty}TD_{Act-win}=\lim_{z\to\infty}\frac{(1/2)2^{2z}}{2^{2z}}=\frac12$$
  The calculation for the $TD_{Inh-win}$ follows the same logic as above and asymptotically reaches the same limit.

2. **Low activator-to-inhibitor ratio** ($1:n-1$ ratio, i.e. one activator and the rest regulators are inhibitors: $m = 1, k = n-1$):
  - $TD_{AND-NOT} = \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 0$
  - $TD_{OR-NOT} = 1 - \frac{1}{2^{1}} = \frac{1}{2}$
  - $TD_{Pairs} = 1 - \frac{2^{n-1}+2^{1}-1}{2^n} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2^n} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2}$
  
  The following two require some basic calculations which we omit:
  
  - $TD_{Act-win} = \frac{n}{2^n} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 0$
  - $TD_{Inh-win} = \frac{1}{2^n} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 0$

3. **High activator-to-inhibitor ratio** ($n-1:1$ ratio, i.e. one inhibitor and the rest regulators are activators: $k = 1, m = n-1$):
  - $TD_{AND-NOT} = \frac{1}{2^{1}} = \frac{1}{2}$
  - $TD_{OR-NOT} = 1 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 1$
  - $TD_{Pairs} = 1 - \frac{2^{1}+2^{n-1}-1}{2^n} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2^n} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2}$
  
  The following two require some basic calculations which we omit:
  
  - $TD_{Act-win} = \frac{2^n-2}{2^n} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 1$
  - $TD_{Inh-win} = \frac{2^n-n-1}{2^n} \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} 1$

:::{.green-box}
In the **1:1 ratio scenario**, where there is an equal number of activators and inhibitors, the “AND-NOT” and “OR-NOT” functions **are biased** towards $0$ and $1$ respectively.
The “Pairs” function behaves similarly to the “OR-NOT” function and thus is **also biased** towards $1$.
Only the two threshold functions show balanced behaviour with their truth density value reaching asymptotically $1/2$.
We argue that the threshold functions asymptotic truth density results are more statistically plausible in this case, given the fact that the activities of the two sets of regulators are more likely to cancel each other out than it is for one set to completely dominate over the other when the number of total regulators increases significantly.

On the other hand, in the **two extremely unbalanced ratio scenarios**, we would expect the truth density outcome to be fairly biased from a statistical point of view, since one set of regulators completely outweighs the other.
Strangely though, the “Pairs” function behaves in a balanced manner (i.e. its truth density equals $1/2$ in both scenarios).
Moreover, we observed that the truth density results of the “AND-NOT” and “OR-NOT” functions depend on the scenario, i.e. the “OR-NOT” is balanced and the “AND-NOT” is biased, when the inhibitors dominate over the activators (and the reverse for the case where the activators outweigh the inhibitors).
So comparing these results to what was expected, these two functions behave “properly” only in one of the two aforementioned scenarios.
Lastly, the two threshold functions show a more reasonable behaviour, being biased towards $0$ with significantly more inhibitors and biased towards $1$ with significantly more activators.

All in all, the threshold functions exhibit asymptotic properties that might make them more suitable for specific Boolean modeling use cases, compared to the other functions investigated.

- **The larger the number of regulators**, the more biased the link operator functions are towards $0$, i.e. target inhibition (“AND-NOT”) and $1$, i.e. target activation (“OR-NOT”, “Pairs”).
The “Pairs” function seems to be less biased compared to the “OR-NOT”, but still for large $n$ (number of regulators) it practically **makes the target active**.
- For $n>6$ regulators, the points outside the boxplots (outliers) correspond to the **asymptotic behavior** of the truth density formulas shown [above](#asymptotic-behavior) where there is **imbalance between the number of activators and inhibitors** (situations close to the extreme ratio scenarios).
As such, when $k \ll m$, $TD_{AND-NOT} = \frac12$ and when $m \ll k$, $TD_{OR-NOT} = \frac12$ - otherwise both functions tend towards more biased outcomes.
Interestingly, in both cases of ratio imbalance, the “Pairs” function results in an unbiased truth density output and that is the reason the lower whisker of the corresponding green boxplots touch the unbiased line (with truth density equal to $0.5$).
:::

We also check for the relation between truth density and number of activators and inhibitors independently.
The following figures demonstrate that the asymptotic behaviour of the truth density of the “AND-NOT” link operator function is largely dependent on the number of **inhibitors**:

```r
ggscatter(data = stats %>% rename(`#Regulators` = num_reg), x = "num_inh", 
  y = "td_and_not", color = "#Regulators",
  ylab = "Truth Density", xlab = "Number of Inhibitors", 
  title = "AND-NOT TD vs Number of Inhibitors") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ylim(c(0,1))

ggscatter(data = stats %>% rename(`#Regulators` = num_reg), x = "num_act", 
  y = "td_and_not", color = "#Regulators",
  ylab = "Truth Density", xlab = "Number of Activators", 
  title = "AND-NOT TD vs Number of Activators") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ylim(c(0,1))
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:and-not-reg-plot)AND-NOT TD vs Number of Activators and Inhibitors</p>

The reverse situation is true for the “OR-NOT” function:

```r
ggscatter(data = stats %>% rename(`#Regulators` = num_reg), 
  x = "num_inh", y = "td_or_not", color = "#Regulators",
  ylab = "Truth Density", xlab = "Number of Inhibitors",

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ylim(c(0,1))

ggscatter(data = stats %>% rename(`#Regulators` = num_reg), 
  x = "num_act", y = "td_or_not", color = "#Regulators",
  ylab = "Truth Density", xlab = "Number of Activators", 
  title = "OR-NOT TD vs Number of Activators") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ylim(c(0,1))
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:or-not-reg-plot)OR-NOT TD vs Number of Activators and Inhibitors</p>
</div>

On the other hand, the “Pairs” function shows a **more balanced dependency between the number of activators and inhibitors**:

```r
ggscatter(data = stats %>% rename(`#Regulators` = num_reg), x = "num_inh", 
  y = "td_pairs", color = "#Regulators",
  ylab = "Truth Density", xlab = "Number of Inhibitors",

  title = "Pairs TD vs Number of Activators") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ylim(c(0,1))
```

## Threshold functions TD {-}

We check the truth density of the $f_{Act-win}$ and $f_{Inh-win}$ Boolean functions:

```r
# tidy up data
stats_functions = tidyr::pivot_longer(data = stats, cols = c(td_act_win, td_inh_win),
  names_to = "fun", values_to = "td") %>%
  select(num_reg, fun, td) %>%

  mutate(fun = replace(x = fun, list = fun == "td_inh_win", values = "Inhibitors Win")) %>%
  rename(`Threshold Function` = fun)

ggboxplot(data = stats_functions, x = "num_reg", y = "td",
  color = "Threshold Function", palette = "lancet",
  #title = latex2exp::TeX("Truth Densities of threshold functions $f_{Act-win}(x,y)$ and $f_{Inh-win}(x,y)$"),

:::{.green-box}
- Both Boolean functions show a **large variance of truth densities** irrespective of the number of regulators, since the values inside the boxplots represent the middle $50\%$ of the data and span across almost the whole $(0,1)$ range.
- The median truth density values converge to $1/2$ for both formulas (as was shown in the 1:1 activator-to-inhibitor ratio scenario), which is evidence that these threshold functions behave in a more *balanced* manner than the other BRFs.
- The median value of truth density for the $f_{Act-win}$ is always larger than the $f_{Inh-win}$ (as expected, since the corresponding truth tables have more rows resulting in $1$, when there are equal number of present activators and inhibitors).
:::

We show the relationship between the two threshold functions TD and the number of inhibitors and activators respectively:

Both function behave the same: the more inhibitors (resp. activators), the more biased is the truth density towards $0$ (resp. $1$).

The *thickness* of the scatterplots is exactly what gives the larger variance/amplitude in the corresponding TD vs #regulators figure, compared to the link operator function results that are more biased.
:::

## TD Data Distance {-}

We check how close the truth density values of the different proposed Boolean regulatory functions are to the **proportion of activators**, e.g. if a function has $1$ activator and $5$ inhibitors (resp. $5$ activators and $1$ inhibitor) I would expect the Boolean regulatory function's output to be statistically more *inhibited* (resp. *activated*).
We find the *euclidean distance* between the different truth density values and show them in a data table:


```r
x = rbind(`Proportion of Activators` = stats %>% mutate(act_prop = num_act/num_reg) %>% pull(act_prop),
  `AND-NOT TD` = stats %>% pull(td_and_not),
  `OR-NOT TD` = stats %>% pull(td_or_not),
  `Pairs TD` = stats %>% pull(td_pairs),
  `Act-win TD` = stats %>% pull(td_act_win),
  `Inh-win TD` = stats %>% pull(td_inh_win))

d = dist(x, method = "euclidean")
```


```r
# color `act_prop` column
breaks = quantile(unname(as.matrix(d)[, "Proportion of Activators"]), probs = seq(.05, .95, .05), na.rm = TRUE)
col = round(seq(255, 40, length.out = length(breaks) + 1), 0) %>%
  {paste0("rgb(255,", ., ",", ., ")")} # red

  caption = htmltools::tags$caption(caption.title, style="color:#dd4814; font-size: 18px")) %>%

  formatStyle(columns = c("Proportion of Activators"), backgroundColor = styleInterval(breaks, col))

- The **threshold functions** have truth densities values that are **closer to the proportion of activators** for a varying number of regulators, compared to the “AND-NOT” and “OR-NOT” formulas.
As such they might represent better candidates for Boolean regulatory functions from this (statistical) point of view.
- The TD values of “OR-NOT” and “Pairs” are in general very close (as we've also seen in a previous figure)
:::

## Complexity vs Truth Density {-}

In [@Gherardi2016], the authors present figures measuring the **complexity** of Boolean functions based on a formula that counts the number of conjunctions in the minimized DNF form (lets call this $con_{DNF_{min}}$) vs the **bias** (which is their terminology for our **truth density**!).
Since we already have the calculated the TD values for the “AND-NOT”, “OR-NOT” and “Pairs” functions in our [test data](#tr-data) and their respective (minimum) DNFs (for the “AND-NOT” and “OR-NOT” DNFs see the proofs [above](#truth-density-formulas) and for the “Pairs” DNF, see [definition](#pairs-fun)), we can measure the $con_{DNF_{min}}$ as:

- $con_{AND-NOT,DNF_{min}} = m$ (number of activators)
- $con_{OR-NOT,DNF_{min}} = m + 1$ (number of activators + 1)
- $con_{Pairs,DNF_{min}} = m \times k$ (number of activators x number of inhibitors)

We notice that the “AND-NOT” and “OR-NOT” functions have similar $con_{DNF_{min}}$ and so we would expect them to have similar complexities, whereas the “Pairs” function should be more complex than both of them.

Dividing the number of conjunctions in the DNF with the number of rows of the corresponding truth table ($2^n$), we get the complexity score as defined in [@Gherardi2016].
The complexity as it is defined, ranges between $[0,0.5]$, where the highest possible complexity ($0.5$) is due to the *parity* function, which outputs $1$ for half of the rows in the truth table, i.e. when the number of input $1$'s is odd.

Firstly, we calculate the complexity score for each data point:

```r
stats = stats %>% 
  mutate(complex_and_not = num_act/(2^num_reg)) %>%
  mutate(complex_or_not = (num_act + 1)/(2^num_reg)) %>% 
  mutate(complex_pairs = (num_act * num_inh)/(2^num_reg))
```

Next, we subset the dataset to the Boolean formulas with less than $10$ regulators and separately to the formulas with more than $10$ regulators, and group the complexity scores according to the three different functions they belong, namely the “AND-NOT”, “OR-NOT” and “Pairs”:

```r
my_comp = list(c("andnot","ornot"), c("andnot","pairs"), c("ornot","pairs"))

stats %>% 
  filter(num_reg < 10) %>%
  select(starts_with('complex')) %>%

    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

stats %>% 
  filter(num_reg > 10) %>%
  select(starts_with('complex')) %>%
  rename(andnot = complex_and_not, ornot = complex_or_not, pairs = complex_pairs) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = 'class', values_to = 'c') %>%

    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

- **All three functions show low complexities (especially for $n \gt 10$)**, with “Pairs” having the higher median complexity of the three with statistical significance from the other two in both figures.
- The complexities between “AND-NOT” and “OR-NOT” do not differ significantly, as expected from their similar $con_{DNF_{min}}$ formula.

- “Pairs” covers more TD spectrum than the other two functions, while the “AND-NOT” and “OR-NOT” dichotomize it.
- TD values are very discretized: points tend to cluster at points that denote either the truth density bias (e.g. $0,1$) or the cases where there is an unbalance between number of activators and inhibitors (e.g. $1/2^n$)
- “Pairs” shows higher complexity than the other two functions when the number of regulators is higher (e.g. more than $10$ regulators) but the difference is not significant since the size of the truth table ($2^{10}$) becomes the dominating term in the complexity score.
So, in general, as observed in [@Gherardi2016], **these Boolean regulatory functions have very low complexity, especially for larger number of regulators**.

:::{.green-box}
As observed in [@Gherardi2016] for empirical, experimentally-validated Boolean functions, there seems to be a **monotonic relationship between Truth Density and Complexity** (when fixing the number of regulators to a particular value).

The more regulators, arbitrarily chosen same-type functions (points here) with different TD values, results in smaller differences of complexity.
Also the bias of the “AND-NOT” and “OR-NOT” functions can be visually shown from the large curvature of the red and blue functions for larger number of regulators.

# CASCADE 1.0 Data Analysis {-}

## Network Properties {-}

:::{.blue-box}
In this section we demonstrate the **scale-free properties of the CASCADE 1.0 network**.
We show that both in- and out-degree distributions are asymptotically power-law.

Also, we show that CASCADE 1.0 possesses partial hierarchical modularity.
:::

Use the script [get_graph_stats_cascade1.R](https://github.com/druglogics/brf-bias/blob/main/scripts/get_graph_stats_cascade1.R) to generate the degree distribution stats and clustering coefficient scores per node in CASCADE 1.0.
We load the results:


```r
graph_stats = readRDS(file = "data/cascade1_graph_stats.rds")
```


```r
in_stats = graph_stats %>% group_by(in_degree) %>% tally()
# exclude the output nodes with 0 (Antisurvival and Prosurvival)
out_stats = graph_stats %>% group_by(out_degree) %>% tally() %>% slice(-1)

in_stats %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = in_degree, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue", width = 0.7) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(color = "red"), se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE) + 
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "In-Degree Distribution (CASCADE 1.0)", x = "In Degree", y = "Number of Nodes")

out_stats %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = out_degree, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") + 
  geom_smooth(aes(color = "red"), se = FALSE, span = 0.58, show.legend = FALSE) + 
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Out-Degree Distribution (CASCADE 1.0)", x = "Out Degree", y = "Number of Nodes")
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:degree-dist-fig)Degree Distribution (CASCADE 1.0)</p>
</div>

Degree distributions in a log-log plot are almost straight lines (evidence in favor of the existence of the scale-free property in the CASCADE 1.0 network):

```r
degree_data = dplyr::bind_rows(
  in_stats %>% add_column(degree = 'In') %>% rename(k = in_degree, p_k = n), 
  out_stats %>% add_column(degree = 'Out') %>% rename(k = out_degree, p_k = n)
)

degree_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = k, y = p_k, color = degree)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = 'Degree k', y = 'Degree Distribution P(k)') +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 'Set1') +
  annotation_logticks(sides = 'bl', outside = FALSE) +
  ggpubr::theme_pubr() +
  theme(legend.position = 'right')
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:degree-dist-log)Degree Distribution in a log-log scale (CASCADE 1.0)</p>
</div>

**Overall, the CASCADE 1.0 network is not hierarchical**, since a large fraction of the nodes ($57/77=74\%$) has a local clustering coefficient $C(k)$ equal to $0$.
Most of these nodes have total degrees (sum of in and out degrees) $2-6$.
So, **the lower degree nodes are not densely clustered**.
Also, the network average clustering $\overline{C}(k)$ is 0.0389783.

In the figure below we show in a log-log plot the clustering coefficient values (excluding the nodes with $C(k)=0$).
We observe that the $C(k)$ values decrease linearly with the degree, approximating a straight line with a slope of $-1$. 
This suggests hierarchical modularity at least for the higher degree nodes [@Ravasz2003].

## Data {-}

Using [abmlog](https://github.com/druglogics/abmlog) we generated all $2^{23} = 8388608$ possible link operator mutated models for the CASCADE 1.0 topology ($23$ nodes have at least one regulator from each category, i.e. an activator and an inhibitor).
The models are stored in both `.gitsbe` and `.bnet` files in the Zenodo dataset [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4022783.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4022783) (the `gitsbe` files include also the fixpoint attractors).

:::

## Parameterization vs Activity {-}

We calculate the `node_stats` object using the [get_node_stats.R](https://github.com/druglogics/brf-bias/blob/main/scripts/get_node_stats.R) script.
This object includes the **agreement statistics information** for each link operator node (i.e. one that is targeted by both activators and inhibitors).

Load the `node_stats`:

```r
node_stats = readRDS(file = "data/node_stats.rds")
```

:::{.note #percent-agreement-note}
We are interested in two variables of interest:

- **Parameterization** of a link operator node: “AND-NOT” (0) vs “OR-NOT” (1)
- **Stable State** of a node: *inhibited* (0) vs *active* (1)

There exist are 4 different possibilities related to 2 cases:

1. `0-0`, `1-1` => parameterization and stable state **match** (e.g. node was parameterized with “AND-NOT” and its state was inhibited or it had “OR-NOT” and its state was active)
2. `1-0`, `0-1` => parameterization and stable state **differ** (e.g. node had “OR-NOT” and its state was inhibited, or “AND-NOT” and its state was active)

The **percent Agreement** (or total observed proportionate agreement score) is the number of total matches (case 1 above) divided by the total number of data observations/models.

A more *robust* and *sophisticated* (compared to the percent agreement) statistic is the **Cohen's kappa coefficient** ($\kappa$). 
This statistic is used to measure the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable (interrater reliability) and takes into account the possibility of agreement occurring by chance.
In our case **one rater assigns link operator parameterization** (“AND-NOT” or $0$ vs “OR-NOT” or $1$) and **the other stable state activity** $0$ vs $1$).

In the figures showing Cohen's $\kappa$, we draw a horizontal line to indicate the value of $\kappa=0.6$, above which we have a *substantial* level of agreement [@Landis1977; @McHugh2012a]
:::

In the next Figure we show the **percent agreement** for each node:

```r
node_stats %>% mutate(node = forcats::fct_reorder(node, num_reg)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = node, y = obs_prop_agreement, fill = as.factor(num_reg))) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
    labs(title = "Parameterization and Stable State Agreement", 
      x = "Link operator nodes", 
      y = "Percent Agreement") +
    scale_fill_brewer(guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE,
      label.theme = element_text(size = 13),
      title = "Number\nof regulators"), palette = "Set1") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = 'dashed') +
    theme_classic2() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), 
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = 'right')
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:ss-lo-agreement-prop)Parameterization and stable state activity agreement for all the CASCADE 1.0 models with one stable state. Only nodes with both activating and inhibiting regulators are shown.</p>
</div>

:::{.green-box}
The total barplot area covered (i.e. the **total percent agreement score** so to speak) is **77.7294779%**.

The above score means that the is a higher probability than chance to assign a node the “AND-NOT” (resp. “OR-NOT”) link operator in its respective Boolean equation and that node at the same time having an inhibited (resp. activated) stable state of $0$ (resp. $1$) in any CASCADE 1.0 link operator parameterized model.
**This suggests that the corresponding Boolean formula used is biased**.
:::

In the next figures, we have **separated the nodes to groups based on the number of regulators** and show both percent agreement and Cohen's $\kappa$:

```r
node_stats %>% 
  mutate(num_reg = as.factor(num_reg)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = num_reg, y = obs_prop_agreement, fill = num_reg)) +

    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

</div>

:::{.green-box}
We observe that even for a small number of regulators, the **median percent agreement score is higher than** $0.5$, though the corresponding Cohen's $\kappa$ score seems to be quite variant across the number of regulators.

Since Cohen's $\kappa$ is a more *strict* score to assess agreement between parameterization and stable state activity we conclude that the *truth density bias* of the standardized regulatory functions might not be quite evident from these data (**we need link operator nodes with more regulators**).
:::

Next, we calculate per node, the proportion of link operator assignments that retained their expected (i.e. keeping the same digit) stable state activity (e.g. the proportion of models corresponding to the cases `0-0`/(`0-0` + `0-1`) for the “AND-NOT” link operator - and `1-1`/(`1-1` + `1-0`) for “OR-NOT”).
We also annotate in the next Figure the nodes experimental activity, which is a results of literature curation (see supplementary material of [@Flobak2015]).

Interesting use cases:

:::{.green-box}
- For any of the nodes for which we had experimental evidence, a modeler could set the link operator to the appropriate value (in the case of the inhibited nodes `JNK_f`,`PTEN`,`TP53` and `MAPK14` to “AND-NOT” and in the case of the expressed nodes `ERK_f`, `CTNNB1`, `TCF7_f` to “OR-NOT”) and he would have a very high chance that the node would be in same state as denoted by the experimental data in any of the CASCADE 1.0 models with one stable attractor.
For example, the data shows that $90\%$ of the Boolean models whose Boolean equation targeting the node `TCF7_f` had the “OR-NOT”, also had the node active in their respective stable state.
Same for `CTNNB1`, with a $92\%$ and `ERK_f` with the smaller percentage among the active nodes, $74\%$.
All these nodes have 2 regulators (1 activator and 1 inhibitor) and thus $TD_{AND-NOT,1+1}=0.25$, $TD_{OR-NOT,1+1}=0.75$ from our truth density analysis.
As such, all these nodes behave according to the statistical table results, if not better!
- `LRP_f` has 4 activators and 1 inhibitor and from the previous [TD data table](#tr-data) we have that: $TD_{AND-NOT,4+1}=0.469$, $TD_{OR-NOT,4+1}=0.969$, numbers which correspond really well with the percent agreement scores found across all the CASCADE 1.0 models.
- `TSC_f` and `mTORC2_c` are always found inhibited and thus the agreement with the “AND-NOT”-inhibited state is perfect and the “OR-NOT”-activated state agreement zero.
- `TSC_f` has 1 activator and 4 inhibitors, which corresponds well to it's total inhibition profile in all the models (with significantly more inhibitors, there is a higher probability of the target node being inhibited).
The TD values are $TD_{AND-NOT,1+4}=0.03$, $TD_{OR-NOT,1+4}=0.53$ and so the percent agreement between the “AND-NOT” parameterization and the resulting $0$ stable state activity is justified, but for the “OR-NOT” cases we would expect around half of them to be in agreement (have a value of $1$ in the stable state) - which was not the case (all of them had $0$).
Probably the network dynamical configuration may have something to do with that.

## Node state and percent agreement correlation {-}

We also check for correlation between the average node activity in the CASCADE 1.0 models and the percent agreement per each link operator:


```r
shapiro.test(x = stats_tbl$active_prop)
```

```

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  stats_tbl$active_prop
W = 0.93418, p-value = 0.1347
```

```r
shapiro.test(x = stats_tbl$`AND-NOT`)
```

```

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  stats_tbl$`AND-NOT`
W = 0.8787, p-value = 0.009442
```

```r
shapiro.test(x = stats_tbl$`OR-NOT`)
```

```

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  stats_tbl$`OR-NOT`
W = 0.73591, p-value = 4.248e-05
```

Data seems to be normally distributed since p-values aren't so much low (for my standards at least :)
Use of Pearson's correlation coefficient is ok in this case.

# CASCADE 2.0 Data Analysis {-}

:::{.blue-box}
We will perform the same analysis as in the previous section, only now for a **randomly selected sample of models from the CASCADE 2.0 topology**.

CASCADE 2.0 represents a larger topology/network with nodes with more than $5$ regulators and as such we expect to see even more agreement between stable state activity and link operator assignment for these nodes (which will be a proof-of-concept for the link operator bias).
:::

## Data {-}

:::{.note}
The dataset used was generated for [another analysis](https://druglogics.github.io/gitsbe-model-analysis/cascade/random-model-ss/main.html) and we are going to use part of it, i.e. the **models that had 1 stable state** (see [get_node_stats_cascade_2.R](https://github.com/druglogics/brf-bias/blob/main/scripts/get_node_stats_cascade_2.R) script).
The dataset is stored in Zenodo [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3932382.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3932382)
:::

Load the CASCADE 2.0 `node_stats_cascade2`:

```r
node_stats_cascade2 = readRDS(file = "data/node_stats_cascade2.rds")
```

## Parameterization vs Activity {-}

The next Figure shows the **total percent agreement** for each link operator node in CASCADE 2.0 (a total of $52$ nodes), which is the number of models for which **parameterization and stable state matched** divided by the total amount of models ($20672$):

```r
node_stats_cascade2 %>% mutate(node = forcats::fct_reorder(node, desc(num_reg))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = node, y = obs_prop_agreement, fill = as.factor(num_reg))) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +

The total barplot area covered (i.e. the **total agreement score** so to speak) is **78.6334916%**.

In the next two figures, we separate the nodes to $3$ groups based on the number of regulators they have and show both the percent agreement and Cohen's $\kappa$ statistic (see [note](#percent-agreement-note)):

```r

    factor(case_when(num_reg >= 6 ~ ">5", num_reg <= 3 ~ "2-3", TRUE ~ "4-5"), levels = c("2-3", "4-5", ">5"))) %>%

:::{.green-box}
The nodes with number of regulators $>5$ have always a percent agreement $\geq 75\%$ between stable state activity and link operator parameterization and $\kappa_{median}>0.6$.
The above results provide evidence that the statistics-based conclusion we reached in a [previous section](#lo-td-bias) is correct, i.e. that the **standardized Boolean formula is biased for larger number of regulators**.

# Random scale-free Networks Analysis {-}

## Method {-}

```r
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/scale_free_methodology.png")
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/scale_free_methodology.png" alt="Methodology Overview" width="3154" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:unnamed-chunk-5)Methodology Overview</p>
</div>
:::

1. We generate the scale-free topology `.sif` files with the script [random_topo_gen.R](https://github.com/druglogics/brf-bias/blob/main/scripts/random_topo_gen.R) - implementation was based on the BoolNet R package [@Mussel2010].
The input degree distribution of the scale-free networks follows Riemann's Zeta function [@Aldana2003].
The `.sif` files for the different $\gamma$'s are stored in the respective [GitHub data directory](https://github.com/druglogics/brf-bias/tree/main/data/random_topology_files).
2. We use the [abmlog](https://github.com/druglogics/abmlog) software (version `1.6.1`) to produce every possible link operator parameterized Boolean model (“AND-NOT” vs “OR-NOT”) out of every topology file created in the previous step.
The more link operator equations the network topology has (target nodes with both *activating* and *inhibiting* regulators) the more Boolean models are generated (see script [run_abmlog_topology_files.sh](https://github.com/druglogics/brf-bias/blob/main/scripts/run_abmlog_topology_files.sh)).
The Boolean model dataset is available in Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4392981.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4392981)
3. We analyze the data from all the abmlog-produced models, **compare stable state and link operator assignment** and produce agreement statistics (see script [get_scale_free_model_stats.R](https://github.com/druglogics/brf-bias/blob/main/scripts/get_scale_free_model_stats.R))

:::{.note}
Most of the scale-free networks studied in literature have $\gamma\in[2,2.5]$ - see **Fig. 5** in [@Aldana2003].
:::

## Topology Stats {-}

Some statistics on the scale-free network topologies produced (see [scale_free_figs.R](https://github.com/druglogics/brf-bias/blob/main/scripts/scale_free_figs.R)):

```r
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/lo_eq_density.png")

<p class="caption">(\#fig:unnamed-chunk-6)Scale-free networks Topology statistics</p>
</div>

:::{.green-box}
- $\gamma=2$ provides networks with statistically **more link operator nodes (targeted by both positive and negative regulators)** and thus these topologies will produce more Boolean models via `abmlog`, so **more stable state data** to compare with the respective parameterization.
- We also observe for both $\gamma$'s the presence of **link operator nodes with high numbers of regulators** which is exactly what we needed from the dataset to test if the standardized regulatory functions are biased or not.
- $\gamma=2$ also provides networks with statistically **higher in-degree for the largest hub-nodes** and thus present **better candidates** for testing the truth density bias of the standardized Boolean regulatory functions, which manifests especially for nodes with high input-degree (e.g. $\ge 8$)
:::

## Boolean Model Stats {-}

<p class="caption">(\#fig:unnamed-chunk-8)Stable state statistics</p>
</div>

:::{.green-box}
- **More stable state data** for $\gamma=2$, even though we had $\times10$ more scale-free networks produced with $\gamma=2.5$.
- $\approx 50\%$ of the scale-free topologies that pass through `abmlog` and produce all possible link operator parameterized Boolean models, **do not have any model with a stable state**.
:::

## Parameterization vs Activity {-}


```r
sf_stats_g2_5 = readRDS(file = "data/sf_stats_gamma2.5.rds")
sf_stats_g2 = readRDS(file = "data/sf_stats_gamma2.rds")
```

We will **organize the link operator nodes on separate groups** based on the number of regulators they have and compare nodes coming from different-$\gamma$ scale-free topologies in separate sections/figures.

For the agreement statistics we will use the **percent agreement** and Cohen's $\kappa$ as before (see [note](#percent-agreement-note)).

Results for both $\gamma$'s show the same thing: **the higher the number of regulators, the more biased the Boolean link operator function result is**.

Specifically, for both $\gamma$'s, we observe that for $n>7-10$ regulators, assigning a node the “AND-NOT” link operator in its corresponding equation, results in it having a stable state equal to $0$ and vice-versa for the “OR-NOT” case.
